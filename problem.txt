The Misson

The server below implements an API called recursive:

http://challenge-server.code-check.io/

your task is to implement an efficient recursive function using this recursive API 


Implementation details

API specifications
API specifications are as follows 
. Endpoint : /api/recursive/ask
. HTTP Method : GET
. Parameters(Query)
  .seed: seed string of the solution's input(Required)
  .n: integer valuethe solution's input(Required)

Response:
. Json object including the following keys
	. seed: input parameter seed
	. n: input parameter n 
	. result: number between 1 and 3000 based on a hash value computed from seed and n
. each input will always have the same result
. the funtion can onlybe executed up to 50 times per hour for a given seed string 
. If this limit is exeeded, the API returns 503 Service Unavailable
. after one hour, the counter is reset and API calls can be performed again with in the same seed string
